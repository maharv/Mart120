<h3><span id="subTitleColor">The Train</span></h3>
<p><span id="textColor">A lady wakes up on a moving train in a seat. She looks around but doesn't see anyone. Where are the other passengers? The train is empty.
She decides to walk through the train cars searching for a single person, anyone, but as she walks through the many train cars she finds no one.
She looks out the window and watches as the train chugs along at a fast pace. As she sticks her head out the window she notices something, her hair, as it blows
in the wind, is slightly gray. This scares her. She scrambles through the train in search of a bathroom with a mirror so she can look at herself. Three train cars down she finds one.
She hurridly swings the door open and runs to the mirror. Her face looks wrinkly. Almost as though she had aged years in only what seemed like 15 minutes. Now she begins to
truly panic. She races through the train, going train car by train car. She notices that with each train car she goes through the furniture gets more and more modern. At last, she reaches 
the locomotive of the train. She takes a glance at herself in a reflection on one of the windows. She looks very old, almost like her grandma. She runs to the conductor''s chair
and pulls the emergency brake but the train doesn't stop. It just keeps chugging along. She goes back to the train car next to the locomotive and sits down. She starts to sob.
It seems like there's no way to stop the train and get off. She gets up and walks to the connecting section of two train cars. She can feel the wind on her face. She jumps. 
Her head hits a large boulder on the side of the track and splits open. As she dies the train screeches to a halt.</span></p>
